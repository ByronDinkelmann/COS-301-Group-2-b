\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the functional requirements of "The Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research"(CSEDAR) registered research project called "The use of Online Discussion in Teaching"(TODT). This document describes the "Buzz" system to be developed and gives insight to how to achieve this implementation for those implementing it. 
\section{Vision}
The research projects aim is to find ways to enhance and improve the learning of students with the use of online discussion. This online forum "Buzz" will become part of the Computer Science websites modules, creating an online space for discussion for each or where relevant. Where students, teaching assistants and lecturers can engage in activities
related to learning the content of the specific module while applying game concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation and consequently experience deeper learning of the course content. 
\section{Background}
The reason for this research project is the problem of engaging an extremely large number of first year students within The University of Pretoria, specifically the Computer Science Department students. Currently available tools for discussion forums lead to the problems that are hampering positive engagement of teaching staff and students. These problems consist of inexperienced users, unorganized content and low levels of excitement.
To combat these problems the "Buzz" system intends to have the basic functionality of online forums, have automated feedback on common mistakes, have a Game-like presentation and have automated structuring.

The University of Pretoria have the opportunity to teach the COS301 "Software Engineering" students while being able to improve current systems of online discussion which can be extended to benefit all students in the future. 

The research project gives the students of COS301 "Software Engineering" an opportunity to learn form the experiences of designing, creating and developing this system, which include learning to work with colleagues, creating documentation, simplifying and improving the communication of lectures and students through a structured forum, using online systems for group work and the basic process of how software is designed, created and developed in business to name but a few.
\section{Functional Requirements and application design}

\subsection{Purpose}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{CRUD}: To create posts on the buzz system so that users in the system can share relevant information with one another and communicate. To allow registered users and non registered users such as guests to view posts created by users of the buzz system. To allow users to update posts of which they control. To allow users to delete their own posts or to allow users with sufficient status level to delete other posts based on certain factors about that specific post.
 
\item{Message Restrictions}: To restrict users to length, content and positioning of posts based on the users status level. 

 \item{Message Tracker}: To mark posts for each registered user so that they can keep track of which posts they have read and which users have read certain posts.

 \item{Thread Summarizer}: To summarize threads, that are over a certain number of posts long, into a new thread for viewing. This replaces the original thread.

 \item{Template Messenger}: To give standard and custom layouts of automated messages that can be broadcast to groups or sent to individuals.

\item{Automatically Change User Status}: To change/affect user's reputation and abilities based on status.

\item{Integrate System with Any Host Site}: To allow the Buzz system to be hosted on any site without any difficulties.

\item{Check Post For Plagiarism}: To use a service provider to check if a post has been plagiarised.

\item{Report Post For Plagiarism}: To enable users to be able to report posts that they suspect is plagiarised (with a link to the original), because the system couldn't detect it.

\item{Netiquette}: To ensure that every post submitted conforms with the netiquette rules.

%%%%%%Taariq%%%%%%%%%%
\item{Text decorating functions}: To allow privileged users to use advanced functions when typing posts.

\item{Statistical gathering}: To advance users to their next level for gamification concept.

\item{Social Tagging Functions}: The system will provide functions which through employing tags can provide flexible ways of using information that supports users with: Finding, Collecting, Storing, Organizing and Sharing Information. It should also allow users to share their tags as well as allowing users different views of the content. Either a personally structured view according to the user's tags or the default admin structure.

\item{Self Organization And View Types} The system will allow the user to organize their content themselves based on their social tags. The system will also allow the user to chose from different types of views either the base, owns or public structure.
