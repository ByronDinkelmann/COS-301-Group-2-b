\section{Use Case: Summarize Thread}
This use case deals with the service of letting privalaged users use pretty text and also the gathering of statistical information. A user will be able to type pretty text once he/she has gained the required level. The original text will then be replaced with the decorated text. Also the marks will be able to be compared to similar users.
    
    
\subsection{Use Case Prioritization}
It is critical to have access to the database of students and their marks in order to rank the students. Without this information the system may be rendered useless in the sense that users are all on the same level no matter what results they produce.\par

To have information is Critical , but to have well organised information is important. If the information is unstructured and we cannot relatively qualify students in terms of their marks relative to others' in the same group. This may cause the system to misinterpret the student having time to use the discussion board for the one who achieves great marks. Also for higher level users to get privalages is important these privalages may include color typing,code typing , use of emoticons, etc.\par

In the ideal system users should be able to communicate with an effective means, i.e code should not look like text, users can be seen as privalged from the type of pretty text they use without having to go and look at their level, privaleged users comments can easily be seen and therefore easily trusted. Users who give out misinformation should be ranked down.\par

      
\subsection{Service Contracts}
Pre-conditions: 
\begin{list_type}

\item The user must be registered(no guest accounts/spectators)
\item The user must have this privilege
\item The database must be online
\item The database must be connected
\item Users want to level up to use privalged mechanisms \ldots

\end{list_type}
      
Post-Conditions:
\begin{list_type}

\item Some users have leveled up.
\item The privalages of users can be seen by other users
\item The privalaged users can type in pretty text
\item Users who are stdents marks can be used to extract statistical information and this information can then be compared
\end{list_type}

\subsection{Process}
A user, that has the required privileges, will be able to type in pretty text(colors,code,etc). The data on their marks will be extracted from the database and their initial level will be determined from their marks relative to others' marks(statistics). Lecturers will be given a higher initial level. Once on a certain level users get access to a variety of text decorating functions.
